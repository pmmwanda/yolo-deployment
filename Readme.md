This is the yolo e-commerce platform automation. 
One need to set up the GCP account and ammend the project details accordingly. 
SSH keys should be created and set up for validation.
This was achieved using terraform; resources are provisioned on GCP and the Ansible Playbook is invoked.
I have used Client and Backed images that were containerised using docker to clone the repository.
